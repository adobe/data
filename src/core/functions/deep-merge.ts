/**
 * Uses datacache to store results so we can avoid expensive recomputations of the same input.
 * This function also uses preventParallelExecution to prevent multiple executions of the same function at the same time with the same arguments.
 * @param fn The function to memoize by storing results in the DataCache.
 * @param version The version of this function. If the function changes this must also change
 * to avoid returning stale results from an older version of the function.
 * @param name The name of this function which should be application unique to avoid hash collisions.
 * @returns A function with the same signature but memoized results.
